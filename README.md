Virtual Reality Project for Fall 2025

# Intro

Escape from Exhibit X

# Mechanics

Explore a museum where history comes alive. Touch ancient objects to see ghostly flashbacks—like Roman markets or Egyptian rituals. Some spots show how the space looked in different eras, and you can piece together scenes by placing artifacts where they belong. Mysterious ghost figures might pop up with clues or warnings.
As you move through the museum, solve puzzles like finding hidden messages with UV lights, matching artifacts to their descriptions, or sneaking past laser grids. You’ll also get hands-on with digging up artifacts, solving cultural riddles, analyzing materials in a lab, and fixing broken relics to uncover their secrets

# Dynamics

Players can explore museum wings in any order, with multiple solution paths. The game builds from simple object interactions to puzzles with a bit more difficulty.

# Aesthetics

 Museum quality 3D scanned artifacts, period appropriate lighting design, and classical architecture create genuine reverence.
